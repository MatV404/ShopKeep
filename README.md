# ShopKeep

This is a small project I did primarily for school, combining both my one of my hobbies (the tabletop roleplaying game Dungeons and Dragons) as well as my passion
for programming.

The main objective of this application was to provide me with the automatization of 'fantasy shop generation', meaning that I would only have to press a button to
perform the otherwise (manually) long process of generation a shop that the players in my game of Dungeons and Dragons can then purchase useful items in.
Eventually, though, I decided to slightly improve on the project (primarily to learn new techniques) and I added a simple form of login, as well as two different user
modes (User, the unprivileged mode, and Admin, the privileged mode).
